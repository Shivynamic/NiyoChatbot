            "question": "Why did my external funds not get imported?",
            "answer": "Sorry to see that you are facing an issue in importing your external funds. There can be several possible reasons why some/all of your portfolio may not have been imported.   A. If you have generated the statement from within our app:   1. The funds may not be reflecting in the statement that was shared. The missing folios/funds may be linked to some other email ID (than the one you generated for). You can try to generate the statement for any other email ids you may have.    2. The funds may belong to a Mutual Fund company that we do not have a tie-up with yet. You can refer to this list of mutual fund companies we have a tie-up with, here.    3. There may have been no attachment along with the email (the actual statement). This may have been forgotten to forward, or there may not be any funds linked to the email ID for which you generated the statement.   B. If you generated the statement by yourself (for example from the CAMS or Karvy website)   1. Your eCAS may be password-protected, and this password may be different from what we set it. Our system is programmed to either read an eCAS with no password or the password as “Niyo123”.   2. Your eCAS may be in a summary format. To track your external investments, we need information about all their transactions. The summarized version does not have it (only a detailed version has it).   3. The statement may not be from CAMS or KFintech (Karvy). Our system can only process statements from these two (and not CDSL, NSDL, etc.).   We recommend you generate the statement from our app (as the process is automated) as it can help avoid any of these errors."

            "answer": "Banks and Mutual funds actually have different regulators, and also have different KYC. Banks are regulated by RBI and Mutual fund providers are regulated by SEBI.   After you have completed the initial account opening (and onboarding) formalities, you will need to complete your bank and mutual fund KYC to unlock the full potential for both.  For mutual funds, KYC is a one-time process. If you are already KYC compliant when you join us, then we only require your signature. If you are not KYC compliant (have not gotten it done any time before), then you will need to complete the online KYC form in the Investments section. Once done, we will help you raise a KYC, and you can start investing.   Hope this helps!"

In short, you don't pay anything directly or indirectly to us.   There can however be charges from the mutual fund companies or the government on your investments/redemptions.   From 1st July 2020, the government has started to levy a charge called “Stamp Duty” of 0.005% on the purchase (investments/purchase transactions) of all mutual fund units.    This is deducted from the amount you invest and the purchase of units happens after this deduction. For eg. If you invest Rs. 1,000 in a fund, Rs. 0.05 (0.005% * 1000 = 0.05) will be deducted as stamp duty and the remaining amount, i.e. Rs 999.95 (1000 - 0.05 = 999.95) will be invested.

It may sometimes happen that after you make a payment, the money gets deducted from your bank account, but it does not reflect on Niyo. Usually what happens in such cases is that the bank debits your account, but due to network issues at the time of making the transfer, the money gets stuck at the bank's end (does not reach the payment partners).   In such cases, the money generally gets auto-refunded to you in upto 10 working days by the bank. There is nothing to be done by you and you don’t need to worry at all.

            "answer": "There may be some charges and/or taxes when you redeem money from mutual funds.   Exit Load charges - This is like a penalty for withdrawing your investments too soon. It’s usually charged at 1% for equity funds when you withdraw before one year (there are exceptions). For debt funds, the duration & charges vary greatly. For Liquid funds, it's up to 0.007% if withdrawn within 7 days   Taxes - The rate of tax can depend on the type of fund (Equity or Debt) and also the duration after which you are withdrawing your money.   You can read about the charges and taxes in detail in our blog. Note: We show you details of the exit load charges and taxes (if applicable) on the redemption page."

            "answer": "Banks and Mutual funds actually have different regulators, and also have different KYC. Banks are regulated by RBI and Mutual fund providers are regulated by SEBI.   After you have completed the initial account opening (and onboarding) formalities, you will need to complete your bank and mutual fund KYC to unlock the full potential for both.  For mutual funds, KYC is a one-time process. If you are already KYC compliant when you join us, then we only require your signature. If you are not KYC compliant (have not gotten it done any time before), then you will need to complete the online KYC form in the Investments section. Once done, we will help you raise a KYC, and you can start investing.   Hope this helps!"

            "answer": "There are upto 4 payment methods available to pay for your investments - Net Banking, UPI,  AutoPay (e-mandate), and Direct Debit (option to invest via OTP, if eligible).   For SIP investments:    Auto-pay is the default payment option. If you do not have an auto-pay set up already, then you will be prompted to set it up (unless you already have it/have it paused/if your SIP amount is higher than Rs. 1 Lakh or if your bank does not support auto-debits) before you can confirm the SIP details.   For Lumpsum investments:    Lumpsum investments can be paid for using all 4 payment options:  Net Banking, UPI, and  AutoPay (e-mandate).   Important Notes:   1. You cannot pay through a debit card or credit card (not allowed by regulations).   2. You cannot pay through someone else's bank account. You also cannot pay through an unregistered bank account (your bank account that's not registered with us)   3. Some banks approve the e-mandate (auto-pay) instantly. Some banks may take up to 3-5 business days to approve. Till your mandate gets approved, you can make the investments using net banking/UPI."

            "question": "What are Investments and why one should invest?",
            "answer": "Investment refers to investing money in financial assets such as Equity instruments such as Shares, Debt instruments such as Bonds/Debentures/Fixed Deposits, Real estate, Gold, Mutual funds, etc.  We know that the value of money depreciates over time. For example, the value of Rs. 100 was much higher 10 years ago than it is today. Parking money in bank accounts is a safe option but doesn’t help much to grow the money. Most banks give interest of 3.5% p.a. so if we consider 7% as the yearly inflation rate then parking money in banks is grossly insufficient to meet the requirement.  So, one should invest for increasing the value of their money to meet or surpass the inflation rate."

            "answer": "Mutual funds are pools of money that are managed by fund managers in AMC (Asset management companies), popularly known as Mutual fund companies. This pool of money is invested in different financial instruments such as Equity, Debt, and others as declared in the scheme details.   This is done with the objective of increasing the value of investments over time.  Mutual funds present a very good option for people who do not possess the time or expertise for investments. Fund managers possess the qualification for the said purpose. Additionally, Mutual funds are regulated by the SEBI so one can trust them with their investments.   Please note: Mutual fund investments are subject to market risk, and there are no guaranteed returns. Please read scheme-related information carefully before investing."

            "answer": "When you invest in a mutual fund scheme, you are allotted units of that particular scheme. The price of one unit of a mutual fund scheme is called NAV (Net Asset Value).  For example, if you wish to invest Rs. 1000/- in the ABC scheme which has a NAV of Rs. 20. This means that each unit of that particular scheme will cost Rs. 20/-. As you wish to invest Rs. 1000/-, so units allotted would be:  Units = Rs.1000 ÷ Rs. 20          = 50 units."

Debt Mutual funds: If a scheme invests primarily in Debt instruments such as Bonds, Debentures, then such a scheme is called a Debt Mutual fund scheme.   Please note that as per SEBI guidelines, Overseas Mutual fund schemes are taxed as Debt funds so are categorized as the same.  A detailed portfolio allocation of a scheme is given in its SID (Scheme Infomation Document) available on a Mutual fund company’s website. Depending on the portfolio allocation, a scheme is categorized into Equity or Debt Mutual fund. Considering their SIDs we have categorized the schemes as Equity or Debt on our platform for the convenience of the users."

            "answer": "Investments in mutual funds are subject to market risk. There are no guaranteed profits, and financial losses are possible too. Past performance of schemes is not a guarantee of future returns either. However, experts suggest that one should invest in mutual funds for 10 years or more as they are seen to give good returns over this time period.  Equity Mutual funds are considered Riskier investment instruments and present opportunities for higher gains upon investment for a long period of time (10 years or more).   Debt Mutual funds are considered Safer investment instruments and give conservative returns. So you may invest accordingly."

We do not have any wallet and your money never passes through us during investment or redemption.  During investment, your money is sent to a Mutual fund company via an RBI-regulated payment partner. During redemption, it passes directly from the Mutual fund company to your bank account.  RBI authorization is required where money handling is involved which is not the case with our investment platform. We just reflect the status of your investments so that you can manage them well in one place.

Please note both these formats are completely different and incompatible with each other.   With a Demat account, you can invest in Shares and mutual funds, and they are in Demat format.   We give a Remat account. So, when you invest through Mutual fund companies directly or through platforms like ours, they are in Remat format.

If you withdraw it in 3 months, the bank will first check the rate you would have received if you took the FD for 3 months (example - 5%).

            "answer": "Your credit card will get closed if you withdraw from your FD. This is because:  The FD can only be withdrawn fully (all FDs will get withdrawn) and not partially. The credit limit of your credit card is equal to the total of the FDs (if you withdraw, this will become 0).   The FD withdrawal balance will come to your Niyo Global (SBM) savings account after deducting any credit card outstanding (if you have any credit card bill due, then the amount will get deducted from FD, and you will get the balance)."

This charge is called TCS (Tax Collected at Source).  For multiple international transactions made in a day, the TCS is not deducted on every transaction but instead deducted at the end of the day on the total of all debits for the day.   TCS doesn't apply to Niyo Global credit card which means you save 20% tax on international purchase transactions exceeding 7 Lakhs in a financial year."

However, at the backend (between banks) the settlement can take upto 10 days. Ideally, the merchant should send the settlement on the same day to the same foreign exchange rate, but if there’s any delay from them, then the exchange rate of the settlement day can be more or less than the rate of exchange when you made the payment.  If the new rate is more, then the difference gets debited (gets deducted) from your credit card account. If the new rate is lesser, then the difference gets credited (comes to you) to your credit card account. This is called “Fx Adjustment” and can show on the transactions page."

            "answer": "What are some things you need to take care of while spending internationally?  Spending overseas can turn out to be quite expensive, whether you are converting money at a money exchange or using your normal cards. That’s why a better option is to use your zero-forex markup Niyo Global card for point of sale, e-commerce, and ATM transactions when traveling abroad.   But before you travel, make sure to use the app to unlock the relevant international channels. For example, if you are making an international e-commerce transaction, make sure both the ‘Online Transaction’ and 'International Transactions' channels are unlocked.    Make sure that you set a limit above the transaction value. For example, if you are making an international e-commerce transaction of INR 50,000, set the limit for online transactions at INR 50,000 or above to have a hassle-free experience.       Another important point! Make sure you always choose to spend in the local currency and not in INR when using your card at POS machines or ATMs. For example, if the ATM asks you to choose between INR or dollars while you are in the USA, please select dollars while making the withdrawal. This is because merchants charge an additional fee of 5%–10% if you choose the local INR currency. We have disabled such transactions to maximize your savings.  If you plan on withdrawing cash from ATMs, do factor in the extra fee the local banks might charge you for using their machine. This is in addition to the nominal charge by Niyo for international cash withdrawals and balance inquiries. Please refer to the Schedule of Charges in the description or the FAQs in the support section of the app.  Here is a quick vlog on things you need to take care of while spending internationally.

            "answer": "While most credit and debit card providers nowadays allow you to spend abroad, they do charge a hefty fee for the privilege they offer. Generally, you are charged anywhere between 3 and 5% per transaction.   With the Niyo Global card, however, you don’t have to pay any annual maintenance charges, and you can spend internationally with ZERO forex markup. This means Niyo doesn’t charge you any additional fees for making payments in a foreign currency, unlike regular credit or debit cards. In addition to this, there are zero annual maintenance charges, and you also earn an interest rate of up to 6.5 percent on your savings.   <Show this table> https://www.sbmbank.co.in/personal/saving-account.php   You might, however, be charged an FX adjustment amount. This nominal charge can be incurred due to the difference in foreign exchange rates between the date you made the transaction and the date it was actually settled.  For example, if you spend USD 100 on November 1st at a local store and the currency exchange rate on that day is INR 80 per USD, your Niyo Card will be debited with Rs 8,000 on November 1 itself. Now if the merchant settles the transaction on November 3rd and the exchange rate that day is INR 79.95, you will receive a credit of INR 5 on that day. Alternatively, if the exchange rate is Rs 80.5 per USD and the merchant settles at that rate, your card will be debited with Rs 5 on that date. These transactions are clearly marked as \"FX Adjustment\" in the transaction section of the Niyo Global app.     In addition to this, Niyo will charge a nominal fee for international cash withdrawals and balance inquiries.

            "answer": "If you’re a frequent traveler, you know the value of airport lounges that serve as quiet sanctuaries in between long flights and layovers. And while typically you either need a first-class ticket or a paid pass to access airport lounges, with the Global debit card you get 1 free International lounge access per quarter and 4 per year at selected airports within India.  As a result, you end up saving thousands on lounge access and also on the food, drinks, and other amenities that are available for free inside. At present, you can only use it within India and not at airports in other countries.  Once you’re at the lounge, all you need to do is present your card at the counter. INR 2 will be deducted from your card, and you’ll easily be able to access the lounge. Make sure that you have a balance to allow for this transaction to go through. Just ensure that the card you’re using is in your name because only one person can avail of the services using one card. Just a heads up, you will have to pay for any chargeable services within the lounge that you want to access. These chargeable services might vary from lounge to lounge."

            "answer": "Security is one of the biggest concerns when you travel internationally. Whether it’s your bank account or the cash or card you carry, keeping your money safe is a priority, not just for you but also for us. With Niyo Global, we make international transactions safer and more secure for you.  How?  When you know you’re not going to use your card for more than a day, ensure that you use the ‘lock’ feature on the app to lock your card. And once you’re ready to use it again, simply swipe back on the app to unlock it.  You can use the ‘Card Locks’ option in your card settings to switch on only the channels that you are using. By default, \"Online Transactions’, \"Tap & Pay,\" and ‘International Transactions’ are locked to keep your account safe. When you’re not abroad or do not intend to shop from international websites, you can switch off international transactions and continue using your card regularly. You can lock and unlock these channels anytime. You can also set limits as per your spending preferences on the app to minimize your risk in case your card gets lost or stolen.  Protecting your money and privacy is easy with Niyo Global, however, despite taking these measures, if you still fall victim to financial fraud such as cloning or skimming, all is not lost. Make sure you block your card and report the fraudulent transactions to our customer care immediately from the Niyo Global app. You can reorder the card once you’re back in India."

            "answer": "Yes, you can withdraw your FD before maturity, but please keep these important points in mind:    The FD can only be withdrawn fully (all FDs will get withdrawn) and not partially.For example -You have 3 FDs: FD1 for Rs. 10,000; FD2 for Rs. 15,000 and FD3 for Rs. 25,000. Your total FDs and credit limit are Rs. 50,000. If you wish to withdraw, then the entire Rs. 50,000 will get withdrawn. The FD withdrawal balance will come to your Niyo Global (SBM) savings account after deducting any credit card outstanding (if you have any credit card bill due, then the amount will get deducted from FD, and you will get the balance). The FD withdrawal process may take upto 5 working days.  Early withdrawal leads to a penalty (loss of 1% interest) by the bank. For example, if you have a FD of Rs. 10,000 opened for 6 months, at an interest rate of 6%. If you withdraw it in 3 months, the bank will first check the rate you would have received if you took the FD for 3 months (example - 5%).T he penalty here will mean you will get a 4% interest rate (5% - 1% penalty).   To withdraw your FD, please reach out to us at global@goniyo.com and we will help you with the further steps."

            "answer": "When you make an international payment, the money is debited from your credit card account on a real-time basis. However, at the backend (between banks) the settlement can take upto 10 days. Ideally, the merchant should send the settlement on the same day to the same foreign exchange rate, but if there’s any delay from them, then the exchange rate of the settlement day can be more or less than the rate of exchange when you made the payment.  If the new rate is more, then the difference gets debited (gets deducted) from your credit card account. If the new rate is lesser, then the difference gets credited (comes to you) to your credit card account. This is called “Fx Adjustment” and can show on the transactions page."

While the limits can vary from bank to bank, it’s usually:   For domestic transactions:    Sending (payments/transfers) upto Rs. 1 Lakh from one bank account. Upto 10 transfers in a day (this is for individuals - merchants are not counted) Requesting more than Rs 2,000 from someone   For International UPI transactions:   The per transaction limit is INR 10,000 and the daily limit is 25,000 INR.   For RuPay Credit Card transactions:   Daily transaction limit per card, set at 1 lakh per day.  For certain selected merchants, the limit is extended to 2 lakhs per day.  It's important to note that these limits are subject to the available credit limit on your linked RuPay card.  If you have recently set up UPI or activated UPI for a bank account or reset your UPI pin, then there is a cooling period (usually 24 hours, but may vary from bank to bank). During this period, the bank will reduce the daily transfer limit (amount and number of transactions). It is usually Rs. 5,000 (overall transactions) in the first 24 hours (as per NPCI and Bank guidelines) If you have not crossed these limits and are still facing any issues, we request you please chat with us."

Banks usually complete UPI payments instantly but there are rare cases where due to technical issues, the payment may take additional time to reach the receiver. If your UPI payment is pending, then you will need to wait for up to 48 hours for the bank to update the payment status to either successful or failed. If the payment is “successful”, then the money gets deposited into the receiver’s account. If it “failed” then you will receive the refund within 5 days (from the day of payment). You can check this status on the UPI transaction history section of our app."

You can check your bank statement after 5 days to check for the refund (sometimes the SMS confirmation can take time, so we recommend checking the statement).

The FDR you received from the bank will always be the source of truth. The mismatch arises due to the following reasons:  TDS (Tax deducted at source): The FD value shown on the app does not account for TDS. This causes a difference of about 10% in the maturity value. Variance in number of days: There can be a difference in consideration of the exact number of days. Therefore it might be possible that there is a difference of 1 or 2 days."

            "answer": "Along with its meticulous process, the fear of rejection is what makes the visas full of hassle. However, there are specific ways to boost your chances of acceptance. First, be authentic; in all proceedings and documentation. The majority of applicants get rejected if they misrepresent themselves through faulty information- illegal personal assets, lack of evidence to prove your eligibility, incorrect name or date of birth, etc. Second, follow the standardized country-specific checklist to prepare the complete list of documents required. Swear by the rule of ‘All for one’ to prepare all the possible evidence to prove the genuineness of your original documents. Ensure attention to detail, all the required documents should rightly be presented at once; you’ll not get second chances. By all means, present a foolproof indication that you will not overstay. Your status of employment, pre-planned itineraries, and the booked travel tickets will play a key role in this. Additionally, you should possess a passport with at least six months of validity when you apply for an international country visa. You should mandatorily showcase the availability of funds sufficient enough for the visit and the entire period of your stay. Keeping all the documents duly attested will help you maintain authenticity. This in no way implies a 100% guarantee of a successful visa application, and hence must only be referred to that way."

            "answer": "TCS is the tax which you have paid but you were not actually liable to pay. While filing taxes, your total tax liability is calculated and total taxes paid are calculated.   If there is excess tax paid from your end, the IT department will refund you the excess amount along with interest (if applicable) If there is a shortfall in taxes paid from your end, you will need to pay the remaining tax along with interest (if applicable).  All these excess or shortfall amounts will also factor into account the total tax liability and the dues related to advance tax. Rules for interest on refund of income tax, According to Section 244A,  There is no interest payment on a refund that is less than 10% of total tax liability. If there is a delay because of the taxpayer, then the period of such delay is not considered in the calculation of interest. Interest on an income tax refund is taxable. Hence, it has to be included in the total gross income during filing of income tax returns for the year when such interest is received. Simple interest method is used to calculate interest on refund of income tax. The interest rate is 0.5% per month or 6% p.a.   How is the period for interest calculation determined?  If the refund consists of excess TDS, TCS or advance tax.  If income tax returns are filed by the due date, the period will start on April 1st of the assessment year which is relevant and will continue till the refund is given.  If income tax returns are not filed by the due date, the interest period will start on the day of filing of returns and continue till refund is given.  If the income tax refund consists of extra self-assessment tax, the period will start from the date when returns are filed or when tax is paid, whichever date is later to the date of giving the refund."

Upto 10 transfers in a day (this is for individuals - merchants are not counted) Requesting more than Rs 2,000 from someone  For International UPI transactions:  The per transaction limit is INR 10,000 and the daily limit is 25,000 INR.

It's important to note that these limits are subject to the available credit limit on your linked RuPay card.  If you have recently set up UPI or activated UPI for a bank account or reset your UPI pin, then there is a cooling period (usually 24 hours, but may vary from bank to bank). During this period, the bank will reduce the daily transfer limit (amount and number of transactions). It is usually Rs. 5,000 (overall transactions) in the first 24 hours (as per NPCI and Bank guidelines) If you have not crossed these limits and are still facing any issues, we request you please chat with us."

While the limits can vary from bank to bank, it’s usually:   For domestic transactions:    Sending (payments/transfers) up to Rs. 1 Lakh from one bank account. Upto 10 transfers in a day (this is for individuals - merchants are not counted) Requesting more than Rs 2,000 from someone    For International UPI transactions:   The per transaction limit is INR 10,000 and the daily limit is 25,000 INR.   For RuPay Credit Card transactions:   Daily transaction limit per card, set at 1 lakh per day.  For certain selected merchants, the limit is extended to 2 lakhs per day.  It's important to note that these limits are subject to the available credit limit on your linked RuPay card.  If you have recently set up UPI or activated UPI for a bank account or reset your UPI pin, then there is a cooling period (usually 24 hours, but may vary from bank to bank). During this period, the bank will reduce the daily transfer limit (amount and number of transactions). It is usually Rs. 5,000 (overall transactions) in the first 24 hours (as per NPCI and Bank guidelines)  If you have not crossed these limits and are still facing any issues, we request you please chat with us."

The UPI details (number/bank account linked) of the other person (who you are sending money to or receiving from) might be incorrect. You may not have sufficient balance in your savings account to make the transfer. You may have crossed the daily transaction limit set by your bank (for UPI).

Your bank account may have been closed/frozen (or converted to a Joint, NRE/NRO account) IFSC code of your bank may have changed (maybe because of some merger)  If it’s none of these reasons, then we request you to please contact your bank so they can help you further."

For RuPay Credit Card transactions:   Daily transaction limit per card, set at 1 lakh per day.  For certain selected merchants, the limit is extended to 2 lakhs per day.  It's important to note that these limits are subject to the available credit limit on your linked RuPay card.  If you have recently set up UPI or activated UPI for a bank account or reset your UPI pin, then there is a cooling period (usually 24 hours, but may vary from bank to bank). During this period, the bank will reduce the daily transfer limit (amount and number of transactions). It is usually Rs. 5,000 (overall transactions) in the first 24 hours (as per NPCI and Bank guidelines) If you have not crossed these limits and are still facing any issues, we request you please chat with us."

TCS is applicable on a variety of transactions, including international transactions on debit cards. To know more about the TCS rates by Ministry of Finance, click here: https://bit.ly/TCS-MoF  The following table shows the TCS rates on international transactions applicable from 1st October 2023:     Note: The TCS deducted by the banks can be adjusted against the tax payable while filing income tax returns (ITR) and hence refundable. In simpler words, TCS is the tax which you have paid but you were not actually liable to pay. While filing your taxes, your total tax liability is calculated and total taxes paid are calculated and excess taxes paid are refunded along with interest.    The TCS deduction is applicable for the financial year and the individual limit is reset at the beginning of every financial year."

At the time of booking FD interest rate for 3 months was 5% and 6 months was 5.5%.If you withdraw the FD 3 months later. You will receive the entire sum of ₹1 lakh plus the interest which will be 4% p.a. (5% p.a - 1% p.a.). Also, a TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) may be applied to the interest amount. If you withdraw after 6 months then you will receive the entire sum of ₹1 lakh plus the interest which will be 5.5% p.a.  Also, a TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) may be applied to the interest amount."

            "answer": "The maturity value shown on the Niyo Global app will not be 100% accurate as it is a self-calculated indicative value. The FDR you receive from the bank will always be the source of truth. The mismatch arises due to the following reasons:  TDS (Tax deducted at source): The FD value shown on the app does not account for TDS. This causes a difference of about 10% in the maturity value. Variance in number of days: There can be a difference in consideration of the exact number of days. Therefore it might be possible that there is a difference of 1 or 2 days."

TCS is a concept where a person selling specific items is liable to collect tax from a buyer at a prescribed rate and deposit the same with the Government. TCS amount will be collected by service providers i.e. banks in our case at the rate of 20% (as of 1st October 2023) for foreign spends in excess of 7 lakhs within a financial year. Currently, TCS will not apply on credit card spends.   Note: The TCS deducted by the banks can be adjusted against the tax payable while filing income tax returns (ITR) and hence refundable. In simpler words, TCS is the tax which you have paid but you were not actually liable to pay. While filing your taxes, your total tax liability is calculated and total taxes paid are calculated and excess taxes paid are refunded along with interest."

Scenario 3: Assume you are not taxable, i.e. tax on your income is Rs. 0 as per income tax, then the TCS of Rs. 4,000 will be adjusted and you will get a full refund of Rs. 4,000 after you file your taxes.

But its only valid for an year so you always have the option to order a physical card by loading 5000 on the account and you can pull the money back once you have ordered it.  The card can be used in ATM's which can be located with ATM locator under travel essentials in the app, The card can also be used for e-com and POS (swiping), but we do restrict cardless transactions wherein you provide the card details to a third person.  The SBM account has an interest rate of up to 6.75% pa on the balance. And the interest would be paid to you on a monthly basis and the interest is calculated on end of the day balance. Here is how its calculated slab-wise:    On the travel essentials under card settings you will be able to lock and unlock the card and set a limit on the card. Also you have a feature under the travel essentials called currency converter so it would be easy for your forex transactions with the card.

The digital KYC requirements are essential to registering on the app, opening a savings account with Appreciate's partner bank, as well as trading accounts with Appreciate partner broker dealers - all so that you can have a seamless trading and payments experience.   To start with download the Appreciate app on the play store.  Sign up with your name, phone number, email, and after verifying your contact details, complete a basic profile (date of birth, address, etc).  Subsequently, complete the KYC process digitally, as mandated by government regulations.   Here are key steps in the digital KYC process, once you have downloaded the App and signed up:   As per government regulation, for a finance app, we'd need a few KYC (Know Your Customer) details. This will include upload of documents to prove identity (e.g. PAN Card, Aadhar Card) Then we would verify PAN number details, and verify Aadhaar card details After this we would ask for personal profile details related to family, occupation details, residence type, and source of income Lastly we would complete video verification, which would be completed through a video verification link     The entire download, sign-up, and digital KYC process takes between 7-8 mins if you have your PAN card and Aadhaar card readily available, and have a stable internet connection.   Appreciate carries out all KYC as required by IFSCA and SEBI, and does not allow users to transact unless KYC and AML checks are completed and passed."

Night time - You can use a new Diaper Cover with SoakerBoo Pad + Booster Pad and leave it on for entire night. It will last 10 to 12hrs!   Note: It is advised by paediatricians to change a baby's diaper every 3 to 4 hours during daytime. But in case they poop in the diaper, then it must be changed immediately.
