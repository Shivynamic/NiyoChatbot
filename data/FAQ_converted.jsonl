If you generated the statement by yourself (for example from the CAMS or Karvy website)   1. Your eCAS may be password-protected, and this password may be different from what we set it. Our system is programmed to either read an eCAS with no password or the password as \u201cNiyo123\u201d.   2. Your eCAS may be in a summary format.

Here, you can select if you want to invest through SIP (monthly) or through Lumpsum (one-time investment).   SIPIf you are selecting the SIP option, update the SIP date (and month) from when you want to start the SIP, the amount that you wish to invest monthly and confirm the SIP.     LumpsumIf you are selecting the Lumpsum option, just enter the amount you want to invest. You can then review the choice, confirm and make the payment.    Important Notes:  1. If you wish to invest through SIP, and if you do not have an auto-pay set up already, then you will be prompted to set it up (unless you already have it/have it paused/if your SIP amount is higher than Rs. 1 Lakh or if your bank does not support auto-debits) before you can confirm the SIP details.   Some banks approve the e-mandate (auto-pay) instantly. Some banks may take up to 3-5 business days to approve.

We do not have any wallet and your money never passes through us during investment or redemption.  During investment, your money is sent to a Mutual fund company via an RBI-regulated payment partner. During redemption, it passes directly from the Mutual fund company to your bank account.  RBI authorization is required where money handling is involved which is not the case with our investment platform. We just reflect the status of your investments so that you can manage them well in one place.  Additionally, all transaction portals that you interact with, including the payment gateway, are fully secured with 256-bit SSL encryption, which is the same online security standard that banks use.  So you can be assured about the safety of your investments through us. :)"}]}

But before you travel, make sure to use the app to unlock the relevant international channels. For example, if you are making an international e-commerce transaction, make sure both the \u2018Online Transaction\u2019 and 'International Transactions' channels are unlocked.    Make sure that you set a limit above the transaction value. For example, if you are making an international e-commerce transaction of INR 50,000, set the limit for online transactions at INR 50,000 or above to have a hassle-free experience.       Another important point! Make sure you always choose to spend in the local currency and not in INR when using your card at POS machines or ATMs. For example, if the ATM asks you to choose between INR or dollars while you are in the USA, please select dollars while making the withdrawal.

Your total FDs and credit limit are Rs. 50,000. If you wish to withdraw, then the entire Rs. 50,000 will get withdrawn. The FD withdrawal balance will come to your Niyo Global (SBM) savings account after deducting any credit card outstanding (if you have any credit card bill due, then the amount will get deducted from FD, and you will get the balance). The FD withdrawal process may take upto 5 working days.  Early withdrawal leads to a penalty (loss of 1% interest) by the bank. For example, if you have a FD of Rs. 10,000 opened for 6 months, at an interest rate of 6%. If you withdraw it in 3 months, the bank will first check the rate you would have received if you took the FD for 3 months (example - 5%).T he penalty here will mean you will get a 4% interest rate (5% - 1% penalty).   To withdraw your FD, please reach out to us at global@goniyo.com and we will help you with the further steps."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are Foreign Exchange Adjustments (FX Adjustments)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you make an international payment, the money is debited from your credit card account on a real-time basis. However, at the backend (between banks) the settlement can take upto 10 days. Ideally, the merchant should send the settlement on the same day to the same foreign exchange rate, but if there\u2019s any delay from them, then the exchange rate of the settlement day can be more or less than the rate of exchange when you made the payment.  If the new rate is more, then the difference gets debited (gets deducted) from your credit card account. If the new rate is lesser, then the difference gets credited (comes to you) to your credit card account. This is called \u201cFx Adjustment\u201d and can show on the transactions page."}]}

Additionally, you should possess a passport with at least six months of validity when you apply for an international country visa.

All these excess or shortfall amounts will also factor into account the total tax liability and the dues related to advance tax. Rules for interest on refund of income tax, According to Section 244A,  There is no interest payment on a refund that is less than 10% of total tax liability. If there is a delay because of the taxpayer, then the period of such delay is not considered in the calculation of interest. Interest on an income tax refund is taxable. Hence, it has to be included in the total gross income during filing of income tax returns for the year when such interest is received. Simple interest method is used to calculate interest on refund of income tax. The interest rate is 0.5% per month or 6% p.a.   How is the period for interest calculation determined?  If the refund consists of excess TDS, TCS or advance tax.  If income tax returns are filed by the due date, the period will start on April 1st of the assessment year which is relevant and will continue till the refund is given.  If income tax returns are not filed by the due date, the interest period will start on the day of filing of returns and continue till refund is given.  If the income tax refund consists of extra self-assessment tax, the period will start from the date when returns are filed or when tax is paid, whichever date is later to the date of giving the refund."}]}

To know more about the TCS rates by Ministry of Finance, click here: https://bit.ly/TCS-MoF  The following table shows the TCS rates on international transactions applicable from 1st October 2023:     Note: The TCS deducted by the banks can be adjusted against the tax payable while filing income tax returns (ITR) and hence refundable. In simpler words, TCS is the tax which you have paid but you were not actually liable to pay. While filing your taxes, your total tax liability is calculated and total taxes paid are calculated and excess taxes paid are refunded along with interest.    The TCS deduction is applicable for the financial year and the individual limit is reset at the beginning of every financial year."}]}

The SBM account has an interest rate of up to 6.75% pa on the balance. And the interest would be paid to you on a monthly basis and the interest is calculated on end of the day balance.

To start with download the Appreciate app on the play store.  Sign up with your name, phone number, email, and after verifying your contact details, complete a basic profile (date of birth, address, etc).  Subsequently, complete the KYC process digitally, as mandated by government regulations.   Here are key steps in the digital KYC process, once you have downloaded the App and signed up:   As per government regulation, for a finance app, we'd need a few KYC (Know Your Customer) details. This will include upload of documents to prove identity (e.g. PAN Card, Aadhar Card) Then we would verify PAN number details, and verify Aadhaar card details After this we would ask for personal profile details related to family, occupation details, residence type, and source of income Lastly we would complete video verification, which would be completed through a video verification link     The entire download, sign-up, and digital KYC process takes between 7-8 mins if you have your PAN card and Aadhaar card readily available, and have a stable internet connection.
